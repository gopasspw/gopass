## Configuration Options

During start up, gopass will look for a configuration file at `$HOME/.config/gopass/config.yml`. If one is not present, it will create one. If the config file already exists, it will attempt to parse it and load the settings. If this fails, the program will abort. Thus, if gopass is giving you trouble with a broken or incompatible configuration file, simply rename it or delete it.

All configuration options are also available for reading and writing through the sub-command `gopass config`.

* To display all values: `gopass config`
* To display a single value: `gopass config autoclip`
* To update a single value: `gopass config autoclip false`
* As many other sub-commands this command accepts a `--store` flag to operate on a given sub-store, provided the sub-store is a remote one. Support for different local configurations per mount was dropped in v1.9.3.

This is a list of available options:

| **Option**       | **Type** | Description |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `askformore`     | `bool`   | If enabled - it will ask to add more data after use of `generate` command.  DEPRECATED in v1.10.0 |
| `autoclip`       | `bool`   | Always copy the password created by `gopass generate`. Only applies to generate. |
| `autoimport`     | `bool`   | Import missing keys stored in the pass repository without asking. |
| `concurrency`    | `int`    | Number of threads to use for batch operations (such as reencrypting).  DEPRECATED in v1.9.3 |
| `cliptimeout`    | `int`    | How many seconds the secret is stored when using `-c`. |
| `exportkeys`     | `bool`   | Export public keys of all recipients to the store. |
| `recipient_hash` | `map`    | Map of recipient ids to their hashes.  DEPRECATED in v1.10.0 |
| `usesymbols`     | `bool`   | If enabled - it will use symbols when generating passwords.  DEPRECATED in v1.9.3 |
| `nocolor`        | `bool`   | Do not use color. |
| `nopager`        | `bool`   | Do not invoke a pager to display long lists. |
| `notifications`  | `bool`   | Enable desktop notifications. |
| `parsing`        | `bool`   | Enable parsing of output to have key-value and yaml secrets. |
| `path`           | `string` | Path to the root store. |
| `safecontent`    | `bool`   | Only output _safe content_ (i.e. everything but the first line of a secret) to the terminal. Use _copy_ (`-c`) to retrieve the password in the clipboard, or _force_ (`-f`) to still print it. |
