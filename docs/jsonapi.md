# JSON API

## Overview

The API follows specification for native messaging from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) and [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging). Each json-utf8 encoded message is prefixed with a 32-bit integer specifying the length of the message. Communication is performed via stdin/stdout.

**WARNING**: This API **MUST NOT** be exposed over the network to remote hosts. **No authentication is performed** and the only safe way is to communicate via stdin/stdout as you do in your terminal.

The implementation is located in `utils/jsonapi`.
