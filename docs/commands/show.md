# `show` command

This `show` command is the most important and most frequently used command.
It allows displaying and copying the content of the secrets managed by gopass.

## Synopsis

```
$ gopass show entry
$ gopass show entry key
$ gopass show entry --qr
$ gopass show entry --password
```

## Modes of operation

* Show the whole entry: `gopass show entry`
* Show a specific key of the given entry: `gopass show entry key`

## Flags

Flag |Â Aliases | Description
---- | ------- | -----------
`--clip` | `-c` | Copy the password value into the clipboard and don't show the content.
`--alsoclip` | `-C` | Copy the password value into the clipboard and show the content.
`--qr` | | Encode the password field as a QR code and print it. Note: When combining with `-c`/`-C` the unencoded password is copied. Not the QR code.
`--unsafe` | `-u` | Display unsafe content (e.g. the password) even when the `safecontent` option is set. No-op when `safecontent` is `false`.
`--password` | `-o` | Display only the password. For use in scripts. Takes precedence over other flags.
`--revision` | `-r` | Display a specific revision of the entry. Use an exact version identifier from `gopass history` or the special `-N` syntax. Does not work with native (e.g. git) refs.

## Modes of operation

This section describes the expected behaviour of the `show` command with respect to different combinations of flags and config options.

Note: This section desribed the expected behaviour, not necessarily the observed behaviour. If you notice any discrepancies please file a bug and we will try to fix it.

TODO: We need to specify the expecations around new lines.

* When no flag is set the `show` command will display the full content of the secret. If the `safecontent` option is set to `false` any secret fields (currently only `Password`) are replaced with a random number of '*' characters (length: 5-10). Using the `--unsafe` flag will reveal these fields even if `safecontent` is enabled. `--password` takes precedence of `safecontent=true` as well.
* The `--clip` flag will copy the value of the `Password` field to the clipboard and doesn't display any part of the secret.
* The `--alsoclip` option will copy the value of the `Password` field but also display the secret content depending on the `safecontent` setting, i.e. obstructing the `Password` field if `safecontent` is `true` or just displaying it if not.
* The `--qr` flags operates complementary to other flags. It will *additionally* format the value of the `Password` entry as a QR code and display it. Other than that it will honor the other options, e.g. `gopass show --qr` will display the QR code *and* the whole secret content below. One special case is the `-o` flag, this flag doesn't make a lot of sense in combination, so if both `--qr` and `-o` are given only the QR code will be displayed.
* Since gopass already supports different RCS backends (e.g. git and the custom `ondisk` format) we do not support arbitrary git refs as arguments to the `--revision` flag. Using those might work, but this is explicitly not supported and bug reports will be closed as `wont-fix`. There are two issues with using arbitrary git refs is that (a) this doesn't work with non-git RCS backends and (b) git versions a whole repository, not single files. So the revision `HEAD^`
  might not have any changes for a given entry. Thus we only support specifc revisions obtained from `gopass history` or our custom syntax `-N` where N is an integer identifying a specific commit before `HEAD` (cf. `HEAD~N`).
