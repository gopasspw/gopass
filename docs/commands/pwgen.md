# `pwgen` command

The `pwgen` command implements a subset of the features of the Unix/Linux
`pwgen` command line tool. It aims to eventually support most of the `pwgen`
flags and mirror it's behaviour. It is mainly implemented as a curtosy for
Windows users.

## Modes of operation

* Generate a few dozen random passwords
