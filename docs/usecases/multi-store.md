# Use case: Multiple Stores

`gopass` aims to support up to 100 mounted substores without noticeable
impact on most operations.

Using multiple stores is the preferred approach to solving different tasks
like encrypting different sets of secrets for different recipients (as
opposed to e.g. recipient lists in sub directories).

We understand that being able to use multiple stores is a key features of
`gopass` and we commit to maintaining and improving this feature in the
long term.
