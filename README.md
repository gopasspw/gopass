## Abstract

> Password management should be simple and follow [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). With `pass`, each secret lives inside of a `gpg` encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the secret. These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file management utilities. - [passwordstore.org](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

*gopass* is a rewrite of the *pass* password manager in [Go](https://golang.org/) with the aim of making it cross-platform and [adding additional features](#features). Our target audience are professional developers and sysadmins (and especially teams of those) who are well versed with a command line interface. One explicit goal for this project is to make it more approachable to non-technical users. We go by the UNIX philosophy and try to do one thing and do it well, providing a stellar user experience and a sane, simple interface.

## Installation

If you have [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.10 (or greater) installed:

```bash
go get github.com/gopasspw/gopass
```

Otherwise, please see [docs/setup.md](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md).


## Upgrade

## Development

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). In other words, create feature branches from master, open an PR against master, and rebase onto master if necessary.

We aim for compatibility with the [latest stable Go Release](https://golang.org/dl/) only.
