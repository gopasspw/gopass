## Introduction

gopass is a password manager for the command line written in Go. It supports all major operating systems (Linux, MacOS, BSD) as well as Windows.

For detailed usage and installation instructions please check out our [documentation](docs/).

## Design Principles

Gopass is a versatile command line based password manager that is being developed with the following principles in mind:

- **Easy**: For technical users (i.e. those who are used to the command line) it should be easy to get started with gopass.
- **Secure**: Security is hard. We aim to make it as easy as possible while still providing a good level of protection against common adversaries. *Caution*: If your personal threat level is very high, we might not offer a good tool for you.
- **Extensible**: While Gopass includes a fair amount of useful features, we can't cover every use-case. To support more special use cases we want to provide a clean and simple API to integration gopass into your own binaries.

## Installation

Please see [docs/setup.md](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md).

If you have [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.16 (or greater) installed:

```bash
go get github.com/gopasspw/gopass
```

WARNING: Please prefer releases, unless you want to contribute to the
development of gopass. The master branch might not be very well tested and
can contain breaking changes without further notice.

## Getting Started

Either initialize a new git repository or clone an existing one.

### New password store

```
$ gopass setup

 \___/'       (_)

üåü Welcome to gopass!
üåü Initializing a new password store ...
üåü Configuring your password store ...

Hint: `gopass setup` will use `gpg` encryption and `git` storage by default.

### Existing password store

```
$ gopass clone git@gitlab.example.org:john/passwords.git

```

## Upgrade

To use the self-updater run:
```bash
gopass update
```

or to upgrade with Go installed, run:
```bash
go get -u github.com/gopasspw/gopass
```

Otherwise, use the setup docs mentioned in the installation section to reinstall the latest version.

## Development

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). In other words, create feature branches from master, open an PR against master, and rebase onto master if necessary.

We aim for compatibility with the [latest stable Go Release](https://golang.org/dl/) only.

While this project is maintained by volunteers in their free time we aim to triage issues weekly and release a new version at least every quarter.
