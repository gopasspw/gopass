## 1.11.0 / 2020-01-12

This is an important bugfix release that should resolve several outstanding
issues and concerns. Since 1.10.0 was released was engaged in a lot of
discussions and realized that compatibility is more important than we first
thought. So we're rolling back some breaking changes and revise some parts of
our roadmap. We will strive to remain compatible with other password store
implementations - but remember this is a goal, not a promise. This means we'll
continue using compatible secrets formats as well as GPG and Git.

## 1.10.0

WARNING: This release contains a few breaking changes as well as necessary
packaging changes.

This release is building the foundation for an eventual 2.0 release
which will drop many legacy features and significantly shrink the
codebase to ensure long term maintainability. The goal is to remove
the support for multiple backends and any external dependencies,
including `git` and `gpg` binaries. By default the tool should be easy to use,
secure and modern. We will still support our flagship use cases,
like working in teams. Also gopass might eventually move to an
fully encrypted backend where we don't leak information through
filenames.

Any gopass 1.x release should still be compatible with any
password store implementation (possibly with some caveats).
Beyond that we plan to drop any compatibility goals.

If you are using different Password Store implementations to access your
secrets, e.g. on mobile devices, you might want to run `gopass config mime false`
before performing any kind of write operation on the password store. Otherwise
mutated secrets will be written using the new native gopass MIME format and
might not be readable from other implementations.

This release adds documentation for all supported subcommands in the `docs/commands`
folder and starts define our core use cases in the `docs/usecases` folder.
Please note that the command documentation also serves as a specification on
how these commands are supposed to operate.

Note: We have accumulated too many changes so we've decided to skip the 1.9.3
release and issue the first release of the 1.10. series.

Note to package maintainers: This release adds additional binaries which should
be included in any binary re-distribution of gopass.
